    "1. Import [The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) Collection database](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection), found on GitHub, into an [Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/) database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a new [Amazon SageMaker notebook instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi.html) for this demonstration. Make sure your RDS instance is accessible to your SageMaker Notebook environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `git clone` this post's GitHub project to your Amazon SageMaker notebook instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create or update the `.env` file, used by `dotenv`, using the terminal in your SageMaker Notebook environment. A sample `env.txt` file in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Add your RDS database credentials to the file: `RDS_ENDPOINT`, `RDS_PORT`, `RDS_USERNAME`, `RDS_PASSWORD`, `RDS_DB_NAME`. See this post's GitHub project for an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Create an OpenAI account and update the `.env` file to include your OpenAI API Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE__: When using `dotenv`, credentials will be stored in plain text. The recommended and more secure method is to use [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html)."
